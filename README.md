# Hi, I'm Altalanta

I’m a data scientist with a ChemE + Pathobiology background who builds end-to-end, reproducible analytics and ML, with a particular interest in biomedical data analysis. I like interesting math puzzles and turning ambiguous questions into measured decisions.

**Target roles:** Data Scientist · Applied ML · ML Engineer (data focus) · Bioinformatics/Data Science  
**Sectors:** Healthtech/biotech, product analytics with real-world impact

## Portfolio (curated)
>  Older learning repos are included but not representative.

### 1) Wearables Readiness (case study) - exploration of basics for wearable 
- **Problem:** Can simple features from sleep/HR/HRV forecast a next-day “readiness” score?
- **Approach:** Windowed time-series features → baseline logistic/linear models → calibration & subgroup error analysis → model card.
- **Stack:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, Streamlit
- **Repo:** https://github.com/altalanta/physiology-oura-baseline  

### 2) RNA-seq State Transitions (bioinformatics)
- **Problem:** Identify cell states and plausible transitions from bulk/single-cell RNA-seq.
- **Approach:** QC/normalization → embedding (UMAP/PCA) → clustering → simple Markov transition analysis; explicit stability checks.
- **Stack:** Python, scanpy/anndata (or pandas+sklearn), numpy, matplotlib
- **Repo:** https://github.com/altalanta/Bioinformatics_Python

### 3) statdesign (power & sample size) — tiny package
- **Problem:** Teams hand-wave power/sample size; experiments underperform.
- **Approach:** Small, tested Python package + CLI for common power calcs with docs & examples.
- **Stack:** Python, scipy/statsmodels, pytest, MkDocs, GitHub Actions
- **Repo:** https://github.com/altalanta/Data_Analysis_Python

## Selected writing
- **TODO:** Link to 1–2 technical posts (model evaluation pitfalls, experiment design, or lessons learned shipping a demo)
